            "Which is an ancient Egyptian iconography symbol depicting a serpent or dragon eating its own tail. For its picturesque metaphor in shape and self-eating activity, ouroboros was adopted as a notable symbol in Gnosticism, Hermeticism, alchemy and being related to \"∞\" symbol in mathematics. Ouroboros symbolize two ends in one line, where two opposing forces are incompatible, but not in a confrontational position. In addition, ouroboros can also be interpreted as infinity and reborn again in the process of self-burning. Just as a cycle system which contains people, events, time, space, and things, everything included will constantly change and begin to develop by themselves. With the eternal pattern of \"destruction\" and \"construction\" recursively. In this anniversary international workshop, \"Ouroboros\", we will focus on 3 direction: biological, spatial, and social interaction, try to explore the unique cycle pattern between destruction and the construction in each fields."
